/** \defgroup Tutorial Tutorial: how to write the objective function in C++ 

This tutorial describes how to write the C++ part of a TMB "project". The
tutorial assumes familiarity with C++ and to some extent with R.
TMB projects typically consist of a *.R file and a *.cpp (C++) file (see example collection).
The *.R file does pre- and post processing of data in addition to calling the *.cpp program. 
All R functions are documented within the standard help system i R.

The purpose of the C++ program is to evaluate the objective function, i.e. the negative log-likelihood
of the model. This program is compiled and called from R, where
it can be fed to a function minimizer like nlminb().

The objective function should be of the following C++ type:
   \code
template<class Type>
Type objective_function<Type>::operator() ()
{
.... Here goes your C++ code ..... 
}
   \endcode
Note that the objective function is a templated class where <tt><Type></tt> is
the data type of both the input values and the return value of the objective function.
The reason for the allowing different data types is that the same chunk of C++ code
can evaluate the both the objective function and its derivatives, by calling 
it with different values for "Type".  The technical aspects 
of this are hidden from the user. There is however one aspect 
that surprises the new TMB user. When a constant like "1.2" is used
in a calculation that affects the return value it must be "cast" to Type:
   \code
   Type nll;		// Define variable that holds the return value (neg. log. lik)
   nll = Type(1.2);	// Assign value 1.2; a cast is needed.
   \endcode

<h2>Obtaining data and parameter values from R</h2>
Obviously, we will need to pass both data and parameter values to the objective function.
This is done through a set of macros that TMB defines for us. To see
which macros are available start typing <tt>DATA_</tt> or <tt>PARAMETER_</tt> 
in the Doxygen search field of your browser (you may need to refresh the browser window between
each time you make a new search). A simple example if you want to read a vector
of numbers (doubles) is the following
   \code
  DATA_INTEGER(n);              // Length of "x"
  DATA_VECTOR(x);               // Vector x(0),x(1),...,x(n-1)        
   \endcode
Note that all vectors and matrices in TMB uses a \b zero-based indexing scheme.
It is not necessary to explicitely pass the dimension of "x", but is often convenient.
The dimension of x is set on the R side when the C++ program is called, and
there are ways of retrieving the dimenson of x inside the C++ program.

<h2>An extended C++ language</h2>
TMB extends C++ with functionality that is important for formulating
likelihood functions. You have three toolboxes available:
- Standard C++ used for infrastructure like loops etc.
- Vector, matrix and array library (see \ref matrix_arrays)
- Probability distributions (see \ref Distributions)

In addition to the variables defined through the <tt>DATA_</tt> or <tt>PARAMETER_</tt>
macros there can be "local" variables, for which ordinary C++ scoping rules apply.
There must also be a variable that holds the return value (neg. log. likelihood).
   \code
  DATA_VECTOR(x);               // Vector x(0),x(1),...,x(n-1)
  Type tmp = x(1);
  Type nll=tmp*tmp; 
   \endcode
As in ordinary C++ local variable tmp must be assign a value before it can enter into
a calculation.

<h2>Statistical modelling</h2>
TMB can handle complex statistical problems with hierarchical structure (latent
random variables) and multiple data sources.  Latent random variables must be continuous 
(discrete distributions are not handled).  The <tt>PARAMETER_</tt> macros are used to pass 
two types of parameters.
- \b Parameters: to be estimated by maximum likelihood. These include fixed effects and variance
  components in the mixed model litterature. They will also correspond to hyper parameters
  with non-informative priors in the Bayesian literature.
- \b Latent \b random \b variables: to be integrated out of the likelihood using a Laplace approximation. 

Which of these are chosen is controlled from R, and is not specified in C++. However,
for a latent random variable it is usually necessary to assign a probablity distribution,
which is done in C++ file.

The purpose of the C++ program is to calculate the (negative) joint density of data and latent
random variables. Each datum and individual latent random gives a contribution
to log likelihood, which may be though of as a "distribution allignment" by users
familiar with software in the BUGS family.
   \code
  PARAMETER_VECTOR(u);          // Latent random variable 
  Type nll = Type(0);		// Return value
  nll -= dnorm(u(0),0,1)	// Distributional assignment: u(0) ~ N(0,1) 
   \endcode
The following rules apply:
- Distribution assignments do not need to take place before the latent variable
  is used in a calculation.
- More complicated distributionional assigments are allowed, say u(0)-u(1) ~ N(0,1),
  but this requires the user to have a deeper understanding of the probabilistic aspects of the model.
- For latent variables only normal distributions should be used (otherwise
  the Laplace approximation will perform poorly).
- The library \ref Distributions contains many probability distributions, especially
  multivariate normal distributions. For probability distributions not contained
  in the library, the user can use raw C++ code. Due to the above rule that 
  latent variables shold be normally distributed this is only relevant for the response distribution.
   \code
  DATA_VECTOR(y);          	// Data vector
  Type nll = Type(0);		// Return value
  nll -= log(Type(0.5)) - abs(y(0));	// y(0) has a Laplace distribution
   \endcode

\section Relation_R Relationship to R
In R you can apply both matrix multiplication ("%*%")
and elementwise multiplication ("*") to objects of
type "matrix", i.e. it is the operator that determines the operation.
In TMB we instead have two different types of objects, while
the multiplication operator "*" is the same:
- matrix: linear algebra
- array: elementwise operations

In addition, arrays in TMB behaves like R arrayes, in that more than two dimensions are allowed.



\section Relation_Eigen Relationship to Eigen
The TMB types "matrix" and "array" inherits from the the Eigen
types Matrix and Array. Users of TMB should be familiar with
the <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TutorialMatrixClass.html">Eigen documentation</a>.
