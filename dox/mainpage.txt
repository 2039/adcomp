\section Relation_R Relationship to R
In R you can apply both matrix multiplication ("%*%")
and elementwise multiplication ("*") to objects of
type "matrix", i.e. it is the operator that determines the operation.
In TMB we instead have two different types of objects, while
the multiplication operator "*" is the same:
- matrix: linear algebra
- array: elementwise operations

In addition, arrays in TMB behaves like R arrayes, in that more than two dimensions are allowed.



\section Relation_Eigen Relationship to Eigen
The TMB types "matrix" and "array" inherits from the the Eigen
types Matrix and Array. Users of TMB should be familiar with
the <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TutorialMatrixClass.html">Eigen documentation</a>.
