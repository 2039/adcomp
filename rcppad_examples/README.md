README
======
This folder contain examples. If "examp.cpp" and "examp.R" both exists then "examp" is a valid example.
Test automation is provided by the files "Makefile" and "unittest.R". The purpose of the test is to
verify correctness of results and to verify that the timings are reasonable. Each example is associated with
a file "examp.expected.RData" with correct output from a reference test machine (For new examples this file is automatically generated, and correctness must be manually verified).
Perform a full test by running
* make clean
* make

A file "report.txt" will be generated with test results and timings. 
If the column "Max." is small (say <1e-6) the example is considered as passed.
Column "timeindex" is the totaltime relative to the totaltime on the reference test machine. 
Thus "timeindex" should be fairly constant.
