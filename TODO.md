TODO
====
- **DONE** Make it work on common platforms (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X).
- Clean up R-code: newton, options, MakeADFun: class(output).
- Roxygen documentation
- MakeADFun: Call dyn.load if DLL not loaded (?)
- parList: use last.par.best as default (?)
- **DONE** parallel_start.hpp does not yet have parallel Hessian member.
- Metis symbolic analysis with 3d example.
- Move methods, such as "parList", out of the object.
- Rinterface should remember to set DLL="..."
- **DONE** sdreport() on R-side to get sd of ADREPORT().
- **DONE** solveSubset to get sd's of all random effects.
- Make importence sampler work in high dim - need a GMRFsample.
- Compile and testing workflow:
  - **DONE** Eliminate need to restart R.
  - Give better message if PARAMETER(name) evaluates to NULL.
  - Improve compile times by either precompiling or allow incomplete compilations.
  - **DONE** Array bounds checking option
- template() should never overwrite existing file.
- Review kaspers class extensions of Eigen classes, in particular array<Type>, matrix<Type> and vector<Type>
  - **DONE** Consistency between matrix and array fastest running dimensions.
  - Desired behaviour of overloaded operations e.g. pointwise multiply vs matrix multiply.
  - Automatic cast from array to vector.
- Make simple example of how to include "adjoint code". pexp(x,lambda) is a good example (cum. dist. function exp. distr)
- Think about general features for calculating residuals, along the line of Kasper's ideas.
